# Hybrid RL Index Trading

This repository aims to leverage **supervised learning (based on time-series and language analysis)** and **reinforcement
learning (for decision-making)** for algorithmic **index trading**. Such combination (**hybrid RL**) is expected to harvest
synergies and be preferable to either such single architectures.

The code was developed in my free-time and is continuously improved.


## 1. What is the goal?
TBD

## 2. How is it done?
TBD

## 3. Why this approach?
TBD

## 4. What's next?
TBD

## 5. Notebooks structure
- *src/*: source code directory containing classes and methods
- *notebooks/*: jupyter notebooks demonstrating the workflow separately on a VGG and ResNet based model
- *literature/*: a selection of papers explicating the theoretical underlinings
- *data/*: set of example input data and categories from ImageNet
- *images/*: illustrations for markup cells

## 6. How to run?
### 6.1. Required Modules
It is recommended to install all required modules by creating a conda environment through running
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
in terminal in the project directory.

### 6.2. Recommendations
Usage is extensively demonstrated in the notebooks, and it is advised to follow such procedure when implementing.
